grub-gfxboot (0.97-25) unstable; urgency=low

  The following features have been recently added to grub-gfxboot:
  * savedefault
    - remembers the last booted kernel
      this requires setting "savedefault=true" within the automagic kernel 
      list and changing "default <entry number>" to "default saved" in 
      /boot/grub/menu.lst.
  * 256 byte inode sizes on ext3
    - e2fsprogs >= 1.40.5-1 creates ext3 filesystems with 256 byte large
      inodes by default (in contrast to 128 byte used before), to accommodate
      for further ext4 related changes.
  * ext4 extents
    - starting with kernel 2.6.23, ext4 filesystems are mounted using extents
      by default.
  using any of these new features requires updating the bootsector of your
  system.
  Bootsectors written by "grub" or earlier versions of "grub-gfxboot" are 
  not able to boot or even access partitions using any of these new 
  features!

  While these changes don't affect existing systems, we strongly recommend
  updating your bootsectors using:
  	grub-install --recheck --no-floppy <raw device or partition>
  to get access to newly created ext3 (with inode sizes exceeding 128 byte)
  or ext4 partitions, or to use savedefault features.

grub (0.97-16) unstable; urgency=low

  grub-install and update-grub has changed location.
  
  There's a wrapper available in /sbin to keep backward compatibility but
  it'll be removed once Etch is release as stable. You _must_ edit your
  /etc/kernel-img.conf and change the paths to /usr/sbin/update-grub. 
  For example:

  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = /sbin/update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = /sbin/update-grub
  `----

  Should be change to:
  
  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = update-grub
  `----
