grub-gfxboot (0.97-32) unstable; urgency=low

  Versions of the kernel Linux newer than 2.6.23, like the ones included in
  Debian Lenny, are known to differ slightly in their binary format, in a way
  that very old versions of GRUB are unable to boot.

  If you're upgrading GRUB in a system that was installed before Debian Etch,
  and you have never manually updated your GRUB install, it is possible that
  your system stops booting.

  In order to prevent that, it is recommended that you install the latest GRUB
  by issuing (as root) the following command after upgrading the grub package:

    grub-install "(hd0)"

  (assuming hd0 is mapped in /boot/grub/device.map to the disk used by your
  BIOS to boot;  in a multi-disk environment you might need to use a different
  parameter)

  Note: even if your setup is not affected by this problem, it is always a
  good idea to keep your GRUB install up-to-date, so if in doubt it's best
  that you update it anyway.

grub-gfxboot (0.97-25) unstable; urgency=low

  The following features have been recently added to grub-gfxboot:
  * savedefault
    - remembers the last booted kernel
      this requires setting "savedefault=true" within the automagic kernel 
      list and changing "default <entry number>" to "default saved" in 
      /boot/grub/menu.lst.
  * 256 byte inode sizes on ext3
    - e2fsprogs >= 1.40.5-1 creates ext3 filesystems with 256 byte large
      inodes by default (in contrast to 128 byte used before), to accommodate
      for further ext4 related changes.
  * ext4 extents
    - starting with kernel 2.6.23, ext4 filesystems are mounted using extents
      by default.
  using any of these new features requires updating the bootsector of your
  system.
  Bootsectors written by "grub" or earlier versions of "grub-gfxboot" are 
  not able to boot or even access partitions using any of these new 
  features!

  While these changes don't affect existing systems, we strongly recommend
  updating your bootsectors using:
  	grub-install --recheck --no-floppy <raw device or partition>
  to get access to newly created ext3 (with inode sizes exceeding 128 byte)
  or ext4 partitions, or to use savedefault features.

grub (0.97-16) unstable; urgency=low

  grub-install and update-grub has changed location.
  
  There's a wrapper available in /sbin to keep backward compatibility but
  it'll be removed once Etch is release as stable. You _must_ edit your
  /etc/kernel-img.conf and change the paths to /usr/sbin/update-grub. 
  For example:

  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = /sbin/update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = /sbin/update-grub
  `----

  Should be change to:
  
  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = update-grub
  `----
