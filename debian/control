Description: GRand Unified Bootloader
 GRUB-gfxboot is a GPLed bootloader with graphical menu patches intended to 
 unify bootloading across x86 operating systems.  In addition to loading the 
 Linux kernel, it implements the Multiboot standard, which allows for 
 flexible loading of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as 
 the GNU Hurd).
