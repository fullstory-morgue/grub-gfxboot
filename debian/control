Description: GRand Unified Bootloader
 GRUB is a GPLed bootloader with graphical menu patches and reiser4 support
 intended to unify bootloading across x86 operating systems.  In addition
 to loading the Linux kernel,
 it implements the Multiboot standard, which allows for flexible loading
 of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as the GNU Hurd).
 .
 This version of grub is patched to do shiny stuff like display graphical
 menus using the gfxboot patches and support for the experimental reiser4
 filesystem. It might also eat the cat.
